## ⚙️ Webhook/API Integration (No Frontend Key Exposure)

All API requests are routed through a **secure backend webhook**, so your OpenAI key is **never exposed** on the client. You simply configure your endpoint and the tool takes care of the rest.
Note- the default API has limited tokens so using your own API is recommended
